# **Trippy - Trips Made Easy**

Traveling to various countries can be a fun experience but it can turn into a nightmare if we can't order food from a menu or read road signs. And hence we had the idea of making a translation centric application which caters to the basic needs of travelling. For example, travelling to countries like Korea and Japan, where their native language is more prominently used, rather than English, would be easier to travel if we didn't have to worry about learning different languages. For economic issues, we are also making a currency converter which makes it easier to track your expenses.
